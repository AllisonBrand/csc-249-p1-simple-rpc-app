'''
Manages units in multiplication or addition operations.  It is a great tool for dimensional analysis!
It comes with a set of predefined units, the user can define new ones as combinations of these. 
All calculated results are returned as combinations of basis SI units: kg, m, s, C, K, for
 mass, distance, time, electric charge, and temperature. 
 Cost $ is also a defined basis unit, so itâ€™s possible to have calculations like cost per unit mass.

class Quantity:
    '''A unit, or a number with optional units. 
    
    Every unit is represented as a 6-dimensional vector in terms of the basis units, with a numeric coefficient. 
    The number in each dimension represents the power to which that basis unit is raised in the definition of a given unit. 
    For instance, newtons are kilograms times meters per second squared.  
    That is: 1 N = 1 [1,1,-2,0,0,0], in the basis ['kg', 'm', 's', 'C', 'K', '$']. 
    A foot is 0.3048 meters, so 1 ft = 0.3048 [0,1,0,0,0,0]. 
    This backend representation allows for quick and easy comparison of units: 
      if you want to check that two units are commensurable (they represent the same physical quantity), simply check if 
      the unit vectors are equal. Add the coefficients to add them. If you want to multiply two units, simply add the unit 
      vectors and multiply the coefficients. It is also easy to define new units, you just need to determine the unit vector 
      and coefficient. This representation is simple and elegant. '''
